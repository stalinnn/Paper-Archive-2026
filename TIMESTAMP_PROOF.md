**Date:** 2026-01-19
**Author:** Xu Mingyang (Peking University)
**Subject:** Thermodynamic Gated Networks (TGN)

This document serves as a digital timestamp proof for the existence of the TGN theoretical framework and experimental results. The content is cryptographically locked by the SHA-256 hashes below. Any modification to the source files will result in a different hash, verifying the integrity of the work at this specific point in time.

## 1. Core Manuscript (Paper_Final_CN.md)
*   **SHA-256 Hash:** `EA728AF982B672B2B34A833C77AC5634B97CA60D88B0B8F1D232255CCC959F98`
*   **Description:** Full manuscript detailing the "Maxwell's Demon" gating mechanism, "Geometric Tunneling" theory, and biological validations.

## 2. Key Experiment Code (fig4_tunneling/run.py)
*   **SHA-256 Hash:** `A9B6C5EAC1F548D44782FCE1278FA514A9AAD8952AB4920C0E1AAA38CDEA5833`
*   **Description:** PyTorch implementation of the Zero-Shot Geometric Tunneling experiment on Rastrigin landscape.

## 3. Engineering Benchmark (benchmark_throughput_chunked.py)
*   **SHA-256 Hash:** `8A792232F5D4F6790C7847B8593CE0661B2B4E5FAC7D4F16D7D5C2EE040BF882`
*   **Description:** Throughput comparison script demonstrating TGN's linear scaling and engineering feasibility.
